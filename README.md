# IntroToMachineLearning

Presentation from November 28, 2018 on Introduction to Machine Learning, given at Galvanize Austin. Adapted from a template provided by Galvanize.

The presentation was given to an audience of interested persons as well as a combination of two meetup groups. The notebook was presented followed by a quick run through of my capstone project and a lengthy question and answer session followed.
